#  Deterministic Animation

* Best when played from start to finish
* Usually fire callbacks when finished
* Can be randomly accessed (instant seeking)
* Can feel physical (bounce ease, ease out is like friction)
* Not very good at reacting to impatient/indecisive  users

## Tweening Engines
* gsap
* f1
* manual (raf + lerp)

## Easing Functions
* gsap eases
* npm eases
* math (sine, modulo, pi)
